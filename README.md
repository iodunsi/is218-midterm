# IS 218 Midterm

Design Patterns:


- [Command Design Pattern](https://github.com/iodunsi/is218-midterm/blob/master/app/commands/__init__.py) - This design pattern is implemented within the app/commands/__init__.py file through the use of CommandHandler, AddCommand, SubtractCommand, DivideCommand and MenuCommand classes, respectively. This design pattern is used to escapsulate a request as an object, permitting parameterization, as included in the instructions on the previous homework assignments.
